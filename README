ZOModel: Zombie outbreak modeling software

### Introduction
This is a simple program I wrote to simulate a zombie outbreak over time.

### Input
ZOModel requests only a handful of parameters to track the zombie outbreak:
+Population: total world population
+Zombies: the initial number of zombies when the outbreak starts
+Win_prob: probability that a human kills a zombie one-on-one
+Eaten_prob: probability that a zombie consumes a human (i.e. no-reanimation)
+Bite_prob: probability that a "victorious" human was bitten
+Mercy_prob: probability that a bitten human is prevented from reanimating

### Rules of the game:
Each day every zombie attacks a single human one-on-one. If the zombie kills
the human, then the human either reanimates immediately or is eaten by the
zombie (which prevents reanimation). If the human wins, the zombie is
eliminated. However, not all humans escape unscathed. If a human leaves the
fight will a little less flesh, then the human will survive one more day
before turning into a zombie. Since humans are compasionate [citation needed],
there is a chance that the victim is mercifully prevented from reanimating
after death.

The simulation continues until either all humans or all zombies are dead.
